## Projects

### 1. [Data Leak Incident Analysis](./data-leak-incident-analysis/)
**Skills:** Incident Analysis | NIST Framework | Access Controls | Risk Assessment

Analyzed a data breach scenario involving accidental exposure of confidential company documents. Applied NIST SP 800-53 AC-6 (Principle of Least Privilege) to identify root causes and provide actionable security recommendations.

**Key Concepts:** Least Privilege, Role-Based Access Control, Incident Response

### 2. [Ex-Employee Access Breach Investigation](./ex-employee-access-breach-investigation/)
**Skills:** Incident Investigation | Access Controls | User Lifecycle Management | Risk Assessment

Investigated unauthorized access by a former contractor whose account remained active 4 years post-contract. Identified critical deprovisioning failures and provided security recommendations including automated expiration policies and MFA implementation.

**Key Concepts:** User Deprovisioning, Principle of Least Privilege, Insider Threat Detection, MFA

### 3. [Phishing Alert Investigation & Escalation](./phishing-alert-investigation/)
**Skills:** Alert Triage | Phishing Analysis | Threat Intelligence | Escalation Decision-Making

Investigated medium-severity phishing alert, identified multiple indicators of compromise, confirmed malware execution through threat intelligence analysis, and escalated to L2 SOC analyst. Demonstrated systematic investigation and appropriate severity reassessment.

**Key Concepts:** Alert Triage, Phishing Indicators, File Hash Analysis, Incident Escalation, SIEM
