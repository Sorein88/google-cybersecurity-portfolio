# Incident Handler's Journal (2022 - 2025) 📓

## Executive Summary
This journal serves as a continuous documentation of my journey and evolution in Cyber Security. It tracks real-world and simulated security incidents, audits, and learning milestones from **July 2022 to November 2025**. 

The goal of this journal is to demonstrate a systematic approach to incident response, pattern recognition, and the transition from reactive troubleshooting to proactive security analysis.
