## **📝 Project Overview**
This project focuses on the development of a high-performance **Machine Learning classifier** designed to identify malicious URLs. By analyzing **32 distinct security features** from a dataset of over **11,000 URLs**, the system differentiates between legitimate websites and phishing attempts with exceptional precision.

## **🚀 Key Development Phases**

### **Phase 1: Feature Engineering & EDA**
I developed a custom extraction engine to analyze URL characteristics, focusing on:
* **Structural Features:** URL length, number of dots, and presence of special characters (e.g., `@`, `-`).
* **Security Indicators:** Protocol analysis (HTTP vs. HTTPS) and the detection of IP-based URLs.
* **Result:** A robust feature set that serves as the foundation for the AI's decision-making process.

### **Phase 2: Model Training & Evaluation**
I tested and compared several **Machine Learning architectures** to identify the most effective solution:
* **Random Forest:** **96.83% Accuracy** (Top Performer)
* **Neural Networks (MLP):** 96.56%
* **SVM:** 95.61%
* **Result:** Selected **Random Forest** for its superior accuracy and reliability in detecting complex phishing patterns.

### **Phase 3: Deployment & Productization**
To make the tool functional for end-users, I built a web application using **Streamlit**:
* **Interactive Interface:** Users can input a URL and receive an instant risk assessment (**Legitimate vs. Phishing**).
* **Model Export:** The trained model was serialized using **Joblib** for seamless integration into production environments.

## **💡 Why this matters for SOC Teams**
This project demonstrates my ability to:
* Build **automated detection tools** to reduce manual triage time in the SOC.
* Perform advanced **Feature Engineering** specifically for cyber security use cases.
* Deploy **AI-driven solutions** that provide immediate, actionable value in threat defense.
